## Project description

The intent of this project was to build a simple, command line interface to an employee database. 

## Application functionality

When the application is run from the command line, the user can:

• view all departments

• view all roles

• view all employees

• add a new department

• add a new role

• add a new employee

• update an employee's role

• remove an employee from the database

• exit the application

## Technology used

The application was built using:

[node.js, v20.5.0](https://nodejs.org/en), an asynchronous, event-driven JavaScript runtime designed to build scalable network applications

[MySql, v2.1.0](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.1/en/), the world's *most popular* open source database

[npm's inquirer package, v8.2.6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), including the list-input feature and maxlength-input method

[npm's cfonts package, v3.2.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cfonts), a silly little command line tool for *sexy* ANSI fonts in the console

[npm's console table package, v0.10.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table), supports passing multiple strings and arrays in a single console.table call; each argument will be formatted and printed separately on new line

    ***Known issues***

    • When the application starts, the first message displayed in the console is duplicated.

    • More generally, new data entered into the database is not validated.
    
    • I have only enabled support for the `delete employee` feature listed in the project "bonus" section; the other "bonus" features have not been implemented.
